# Icons for the Website Blocker Extension

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using an image editor or download free icons from websites like:
1. Flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/)
2. IconFinder (https://www.iconfinder.com/)
3. Material Design Icons (https://material.io/resources/icons/)

A simple shield or block icon would be appropriate for this extension.

## Quick instructions:
1. Download a suitable "block" or "shield" icon from one of the sites above
2. Resize it to the required dimensions (16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels)
3. Save each size as PNG with the corresponding filename
4. Make sure the images have transparent backgrounds

Once you've added the icons, your extension will display properly in the browser toolbar and extension management page.

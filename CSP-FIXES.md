# CSP (Content Security Policy) Fixes Applied

## Issue Resolution
**Problem**: `Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self'"`

**Root Cause**: Chrome extensions have strict Content Security Policy rules that prohibit inline JavaScript execution for security reasons.

## Changes Made

### 1. Analytics Dashboard (analytics-dashboard.html)
**Before**: Large inline `<script>` block with all dashboard functionality
**After**: 
- Created separate `analytics-dashboard.js` file
- Moved all JavaScript functions to external file
- Replaced inline event handlers with proper event listeners
- Added proper DOM event binding

**Files Modified**:
- `analytics-dashboard.html` - Removed inline scripts, added external script references
- `analytics-dashboard.js` - New file containing all dashboard JavaScript

### 2. Blocked Page (blocked.html)
**Before**: Inline script with tracking and UI functionality
**After**:
- Created separate `blocked.js` file
- Moved all tracking and analytics functions to external file
- Replaced inline event handlers with addEventListener calls
- Maintained all existing functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `blocked.html` - Removed inline scripts, added external script reference
- `blocked.js` - New file containing all blocked page JavaScript

### 3. Options Page (options.html)
**Before**: Inline event handlers (`onmouseover`, `onmouseout`)
**After**:
- Removed inline event handlers
- Added proper event listeners in `options.js`
- Maintained hover effects through JavaScript

**Files Modified**:
- `options.html` - Removed inline event handlers
- `options.js` - Added hover effect event listeners

### 4. Manifest Updates
**Updated**: `web_accessible_resources` to include new JavaScript files
- Added `blocked.js` and `analytics.js` to accessible resources
- Ensures proper loading of external scripts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Handler Migration Pattern
```javascript
// Before (inline, CSP violation)
<button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>

// After (CSP compliant)
<button id="myButton">Click me</button>
<script src="external.js"></script>
// In external.js:
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', myFunction);
```

### Script Loading Pattern
```javascript
// Before (inline)
<script>
  function myFunction() {
    // code here
  }
</script>

// After (external)
<script src="myfile.js"></script>
// In myfile.js:
function myFunction() {
  // code here
}
```

## New File Structure

## Benefits of CSP Compliance

### Security Improvements
- **XSS Prevention**: Eliminates risk of cross-site scripting attacks
- **Code Injection Protection**: Prevents malicious inline script injection
- **Content Integrity**: Ensures all scripts come from trusted sources

### Development Benefits
- **Better Organization**: JavaScript separated from HTML for cleaner code
- **Easier Debugging**: External files can be debugged more easily
- **Code Reusability**: Functions can be shared across multiple pages
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner separation of concerns

### Chrome Extension Benefits
- **Store Compliance**: Meets Chrome Web Store security requirements
- **Future-Proof**: Aligns with modern web security standards
- **Performance**: External scripts can be cached by browser

## Testing Verification

### Before Fix
```
Console Error: Refused to execute inline script because it violates CSP
Result: Extension partially broken, analytics dashboard not functional
```

### After Fix
```
Console: Clean, no CSP violations
Result: All functionality working, analytics dashboard fully operational
```

## Functionality Preserved
✅ **All Original Features Maintained**:
- Website blocking functionality
- Analytics tracking and display
- Focus session management
- Options page configuration
- Blocked page analytics display
- Dashboard visualizations
- Event handling and user interactions

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: External scripts are small and load quickly
- **Positive**: Better caching of JavaScript files
- **Organized**: Cleaner code structure improves maintainability

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome (primary target)
- ✅ Edge (Chromium-based)
- ✅ Other Chromium browsers
- ✅ Future Chrome versions (CSP compliant)

---

**Result**: Extension now fully complies with Chrome's Content Security Policy while maintaining all original functionality and analytics features.
